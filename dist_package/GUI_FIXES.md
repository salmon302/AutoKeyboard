```

## Layout Improvements

- ✅ Consistent layout across all interface elements
- ✅ Better responsive behavior of layout components

## User Experience Improvements

3. **Consistency**: Uniform spacing and layout across all dialogs
4. **Responsive**: Layout adapts better to content size
5. **Professional**: Clean, organized appearance

## Validation

- ✅ Hotkey capture dialogs show all buttons
- ✅ Quick setup dialog maintains proper layout
- ✅ All functionality remains intact
- ✅ No regression in existing features

## Distribution Update
