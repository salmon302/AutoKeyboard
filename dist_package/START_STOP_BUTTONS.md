## Interface Layout Changes

### Button Organization
The action buttons are now organized in **two rows** for better space utilization:

**Row 1**: Primary action buttons
- Clear | Quick Setup | **Start Script** | **Stop Script**

**Row 2**: Script management buttons  
- Edit Script | Save Script | Load Script

### Window Size Adjustment
- **Height increased**: From 400px to 450px to accommodate the new button row
- **Width maintained**: 650px (optimal for all interface elements)
- **Layout**: Professional two-row button arrangement

## Usage Scenarios

### Quick Script Execution
1. Record keys or use Quick Setup
2. Click **"Start Script"** to begin playback
3. Click **"Stop Script"** if you need to halt execution early

### Precise Control
- **Alternative to Hotkeys**: Some users prefer mouse control over hotkeys
- **Visual Confirmation**: Button states provide clear feedback about what's happening
- **Emergency Stop**: Easy way to stop runaway scripts immediately

### Workflow Integration
- **Load and Run**: Load a saved script, then click "Start Script"
- **Test Scripts**: Start/stop to test timing and behavior
- **Presentation Mode**: Control automation during demos or presentations

## Technical Implementation

### Button State Logic
```
Recording State:
- Start Script: Disabled
- Stop Script: Disabled

Idle State (with script):
- Start Script: Enabled  
- Stop Script: Disabled

Playing State:
- Start Script: Disabled
- Stop Script: Enabled

Idle State (no script):
- Start Script: Enabled (shows warning)
- Stop Script: Disabled
```

### Error Handling

- **Safe Operation**: No conflicting operations can be triggered
